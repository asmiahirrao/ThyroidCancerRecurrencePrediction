## Introduction

Thyroid cancer is one of the most common endocrine cancers, and its recurrence can significantly impact the prognosis and treatment strategy for patients. This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide insights into the likelihood of cancer recurrence, aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert dataset source if applicable]. It contains the following features:

- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Gender**: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).
- **Tumor Size**: Size of the tumor.
- **Histology Type**: Type of thyroid cancer.
- **Initial Treatment**: Treatment administered initially.
- **Recurred**: Indicates whether the cancer has recurred (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

The data is preprocessed using one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if applicable)
